# Glitch for VS Code

Glitch is a collaborative coding community and application host featuring live co-editing and instantly available apps. Glitch for VS Code brings Glitch into your favorite editor, allowing you to create, edit, and share projects on Glitch right from VS Code.

This repository doesn't host the extension source code. It's for collecting feedback and providing a centralized place for documentation and other resources.

For now though, you can find documentation on the [Extension Marketplace page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glitch.glitch).
